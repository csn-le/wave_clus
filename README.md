Wave_clus 3
===========

Wave_clus is a fast and unsupervised algorithm for spike detection and sorting that runs under Windows, Mac or Linux operating systems.

To install, download this repository into a folder. In MATLAB (R2009b or higher) go to *Set Path* and add the directory `wave_clus` with the subfolders to the MATLAB path.

How to use
------

There are two ways to use Wave_clus:

1. To open the GUI, type `wave_clus` in the MATLAB command prompt. 

2. To use the batch functions, type `Get_spikes('filename.ext')`, where `.ext` is a file extension (eg. `.mat`), for the spike detection; this will save a file `filename_spikes.mat` in the current directory.
    Subsequently, run `Do_clustering('filename_spikes.mat')` to do the sorting. You can process multiple files at once or specific channels of multiple files.

Wave_clus can read raw data or already detected spikes generated with electrophysiology data acquisition systems (Blackrock, Neuralynx, Plexon, TDT, Intan, etc) or saved as matlab files (`*.mat`). It can also deal with tetrodes and high-density probes. See [the Wiki page for Input Files](https://github.com/csn-le/wave_clus/wiki/Input-Files) for more details.

Either way, wave_clus generates a file **`times_filename.mat`**, with a variable **`cluster_class`** of two columns: the first column is the class of the spike and the second one is the spike time in ms.

Wave_clus is free (and therefore without any warranty) for any non-commercial applications. For any commercial application please contact Prof. Rodrigo Quian Quiroga.
